echo "I believe that software should be treated as a foundation for collective human progress, rather than a walled garden. Every single day, tools like $TOOL empower me to learn, create, and solve complex problems simply because their creators chose to share them with the world. To me, the core of open source is about $FREEDOM. It represents the inherent right to study, the freedom to tinker without boundaries, and the flexibility to adapt existing systems to fit our unique, evolving requirements." >> "$OUTPUT"

echo "Standing directly on the shoulders of giants, I recognize that my own technological journey is fueled entirely by community contributions. In the true spirit of the free software movement, if given the opportunity and resources, I would actively build a $BUILD and distribute it freely under an open-source license. By contributing back to the FOSS ecosystem, we collectively ensure that technology continues to serve everybody, governed by transparent collaboration rather than proprietary control." >> "$OUTPUT"
